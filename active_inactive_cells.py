Active and Inactive cells after k Days
Given a binary array of size n where n > 3. A true (or 1) value
in the array means active and false (or 0) means inactive. Given a
number k, the task is to find count of active and inactive cells
after k days. After every day, status of iâ€™th cell becomes active if
left and right cells are not same and inactive if left and right cell
are same (both 0 or both 1).

Since there are no cells before leftmost and after rightmost cells,
the value cells before leftmost and after rightmost cells is always
considered as 0 (or inactive).


Examples:

Input  : cells[] = {1, 0, 1, 1}, k = 2
Output : Active cells = 3, Inactive cells = 1
After 1 day,  cells[] = {0, 0, 1, 1}
After 2 days, cells[] = {0, 1, 1, 1}

Input : cells[] = {0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1},  k = 3
Output: Active Cells = 2 , Inactive Cells = 6
Explanation : 
After 1 day, cells[] = {1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}
After 2 days, cells[] = {0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}
After 3 days, cells[] =  {1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}

Input : cells[] = {0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0},  k = 4
Output: Active Cells = 3 , Inactive Cells = 5
